# MF-OSEMO Benchmarking â€“ Branin & Currin

This folder contains my experiments using the **MF-OSEMO** (Multi-Fidelity Output Space Entropy Search for Multi-Objective Optimization) framework, based on the [AAAI Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01542) and [JAIR Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06980) papers by Syrine Belakaria et al.

These experiments explore multi-fidelity, multi-objective Bayesian optimization on two classical problems: **Branin** and **Currin**. The code was based on the [official MF-OSEMO GitHub repository](https://github.com/belakaria/MF-OSEMO).

- [`mfosemo-env.yml`](./MF-OSEMO-env.yml) â€” Conda environment file for reproducing experiments.

## ðŸ§ª Benchmarks

### 1. Branin Function (Multi-Objective, Multi-Fidelity)

- **Objectives:** 2D objectives from the Branin test suite.
- **Limitation:** I was unable to fully visualize the Pareto front results or performance due to limited support in the framework.

---

### 2. Currin Function (Multi-Objective, Multi-Fidelity)

- **Objectives:** Currinâ€™s 2D nonlinear functions with known conflicting behavior.
- **Note:** Like Branin, I could not visualize the output space or convergence, so performance is uncertain.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- The MF-OSEMO codebase is structured differently from most modern BoTorch workflows.
- Feel free to improve the plotting or logging utilities if reproducibility is important.
- Not much to glean from this library, as I could not analyze the results and had to do an overhauling of code due to several code errors.
